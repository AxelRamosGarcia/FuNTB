# FuNTB
FunTB analyzes non-synonymous mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains, constructing functional networks that highlight gene-phenotype relationships. It identifies unique and shared genetic mutations across contrasting phenotypes, helping to generate hypotheses on the genetic basis of phenotypic traits in Mtb.
